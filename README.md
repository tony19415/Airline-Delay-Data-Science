## Airline Delay Data
Data Science Skill Practice Supervised Machine Learning

[Source of data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/ot_delaycause1.asp)

Filtered the data to select either flights that arrived in time or no longer than 15 minutes and those that arrived later than 15 minutes as late.
Used correlation matrix for feature selection using only numerical values

Tried using decision tree model, keras, knn classifications using delay data
